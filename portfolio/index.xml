      <title>Asteroidz Game</title>

      <description>After a couple of low-level, intro projects into Android App development, my partner and I were given two weeks to develop an app of our own. Through some trial and error, we settled on a game (that we later dubbed Asteroidz) in which you would control a spaceship that is along the bottom of the screen. Touching either side of the screen moves the ship back and forth, where you must avoid asteroids to rack up the highest score possible.</description>

      <title>Bluestone Analytics Internship</title>

      <description>I have greatly enjoyed my time with Bluestone so far. As a smaller company, Bluestone has afforded the opportunity to be involved in a great variety of tasks. I have gained experience in and learned basic crptography and security practices, which have proved useful. I have also been able to work with Raspberry Pi devices. I have become skilled in the setup and configuration of these devices to specific needs.</description>

      <title>Calculator App</title>

      <description>This project was my first GUI app that I created, all the way back in my Fundamentals of Programming II class. We were tasked with creating a copy of the iOS calculator and were graded on functionality as well as aestic similarities. I earned a 95&amp;frasl;100 on the assignment, receiving full marks for aestetics, but being docked five points for my clear method not working completely correct. Nonetheless, this was a cool project because I got to see the my own hard work come to fruition in an app that I could actually use.</description>

      <title>Software Development Projects</title>

      <description>These were fun projects because they was my first true collaborative project. My team of four students, including myself, were put together and tasked with developing these two apps, with only a little bit of starter code from our professor. I was the Git Repo Manager and focused on the display side of the projects, though we all worked on the backend coding to varying degrees.
The War app (pictured above) was a challenge at first, as we could not get our two &amp;ldquo;player&amp;rdquo; objects to work correctly.</description>

      <title>Sprint Generator</title>

      <description>This project is a particular source of pride for myself because of its practicality and usefulness.
As a running back, sprints are important in my training. However, running the same set distances over and over is not only boring, but it is also not the best training. I could run anywhere from five to 100 yards during any given play (I don&amp;rsquo;t train to get tackled for a loss). So, in an attempt to simulate the randomness of the game of football, the idea of the Sprint Generator came into mind.</description>

      <title>Summer 2017 Internship</title>

      <description>I worked for Sherman Digital LLC, headed by my older brother. Though this was odd at first, having my brother as a boss, we were able to get past this and have a professional relationship while on the job. My focus over the course of this internship was centered around the development of static sites, along with some additional applications that I built. You can check out some of the sites to the right.</description>

      <title>Theory of Computation</title>

      <description>In my Theory of Computation class, we were tasked with finding out if a Context Free Language was decidable or not. To do this, we were to use an algorithm from our textbook that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the easiest to look at, to say the least. I kept getting tripped up along the way for one reason or another, so out of frustration, I decided to write a program that would follow the algorithm and print out the answer for me.</description>
